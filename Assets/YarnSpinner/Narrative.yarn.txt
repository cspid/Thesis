Mine's Elin. Really it's Elinka 
but she hasn't let me call her that since fourth grade. 
I'm not sure if someone said something to her or what, 
but one day she came home from school and she just was Elin.
[[Did that bother you?|Bother]]
[[That's a nice name too.|Nice]]

No, it didn't. Her mother called her Elinka right to the end, it would drive her to fits, slamming doors - real teenage soap stuff.
[[I mean at that age they're basically impossible. Especially this generation.|End]]

It was my grandmother's name, but my wife's idea.

We were talking about...
->Our kids
->Your wife
Your kid's same age as mine, yeah?
So about 8 when the Challenger happened. 
Did she see it?
->The Challenger?
Yeah.
->Yeah, she saw it at school. 
->She saw it on the news.
Elin saw it at school.
She said they brought all the kids, all the different grades into the auditorium.
They had done a whole week leading up to it
had them writing letters to Judith Resnick, building a styrophome moon and planets.
->She was one of th-
->We used to make those f-
She said they wheeled out a huge television.
And they had them all count down together.
...
...man I'm sorry, I've just been going on and on. 
-> Hey, no, it's totally alright
-> Maybe about time to call it a night
Look, all I wanted to get at - to ask you...
Father to father
Do you notice any difference in her since that happened
->Difference in who?
->Since what happened?
Your daughter - did you notice any difference in her after she saw the Challenger?
->Yes
->No
I felt like she was different after that
she came home and she described it to me super vividly
how the shuttle came apart
she knew the names of all the different parts of the spaceship
...
->...
->...
That night we visited her mom, and she described it again.
It was way past visiting hours but Murray - he's a night supervisor, really good guy -
he let us stay if we weren't too loud
she whispers how it happened to her Mom - she hadn't seen it, no one had even told her
Elinka's whisper voice blending into the sound of the machines.
->I'm so sorry
No, I'm not trying to - 
With everything that came after, Elinka was a lot more together that I was. 
She's 8, and she's talking me down
Telling me it'll be alright
->Kids handle things different
->That must have been strange
You said it.
I wonder about what changes you can attribute to one thing or the other, you know?
->In what sense?
->What changes do you mean?
Can you think of anything in your own life that if it had happened differently,
maybe not happened at all, or whater,
That you would be a different person because of it?
->Yeah, I can.
->Ask me two beers ago.
I just wonder how many kids saw that, in their high school gym, or in the window of a furniture store
and what it said to them.
What do they bring back to their lives from seeing that?
->It's just the two of you now?
Just the two of us now. 
I'm away a lot, and she's 15 now. Whatever changes she makes now, happen to her, I don't have much say.
->I know that feeling.
->I'm lucky if mine talks to me.
